### About the Lab

The TRACE Lab at the University of Cambridge is a research group focused on building trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems for high-stakes settings, like healthcare, education, and public safety. We develop new algorithms and tools that support effective human-AI interaction and manage the partnership between humans and AI agents. Drawing from machine learning, human–computer interaction, and social science, we investigate when and how AI can be trusted, integrated into decision-making, and evaluated in ecologically valid setting with partners across government, industry, and civil society (e.g., Partnership on AI, Mozilla, RAII, OECD)
